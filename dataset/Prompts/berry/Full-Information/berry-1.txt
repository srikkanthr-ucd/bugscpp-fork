Consider the following C++ function. The function as written has an error and I require your assistance in fixing it. In the code the variables defined and their meaning are as follows.

`RA()` - this is a function that returns a pointer. 
`RKB()` - this is a function that returns a pointer.
The datatypes of `RA()` and `RKB()` are customly defined and their exact outline is not important.
`*RA()->v.i` returns the value stored by `RA()` and is a 32 bit unsigned integer.

The purpose of the code is to store the value of `~*RKB()` in `RA()`.

```cpp
opcase(FLIP): {
             bvalue *dst = RA(), *a = RKB();
             if (var_isint(a)) {
                var_setint(dst, -a->v.i);
             } else if (var_isinstance(a)) {
                ins_unop(vm, "~", *RKB());
                reg = vm->reg;
```

When the above code is run on an input where the value of `RKB()` is 3, the output is 4294967293, but the intended output is 4294967292.

Please output the entire function.
