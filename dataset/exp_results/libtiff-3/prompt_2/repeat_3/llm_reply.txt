{
  "error": [
    {
      "line_number": 6,
      "error_type": "error due to division by zero",
      "explanation": "The variable `signum` is not checked for the value SIGFPE, which indicates a floating-point exception, and hence the program will crash with a division by zero error."
    },

      "explanation": "The program exits with an exit code of 2 when a floating-point exception occurs, but it exits with an exit code of 1 for all other signals. This inconsistency may cause problems in scripts or programs that rely on the exit code to determine the cause of the program's termination."
