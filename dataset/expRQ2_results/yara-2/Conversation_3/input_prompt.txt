You are a automated program repair tool for C and C++. Your task is to provide a fix for the buggy function below.

<<< Buggy Function:
static int _yr_scan_wicompare(
    const uint8_t* data,
    size_t data_size,
    uint8_t* string,
    size_t string_length)
{
  const uint8_t* s1 = data;
  const uint8_t* s2 = string;

  size_t i = 0;

  if (data_size < string_length * 2)
    return 0;

  while (i < string_length && yr_lowercase[*s1] == yr_lowercase[*s2])
  {
    s1+=2;
    s2++;
    i++;
  }

  return (int) ((i == string_length) ? i * 2 : 0);
}

>>>

The following was the errors outputted by a failed test case.

<<< Test Failed Log:
tests/test-rules.c:1420: rule matches (but shouldn't)
FAIL test-rules (exit status: 1)
>>>

The following is the relevant code of that failed test case.

<<< Test Code:
  assert_false_rule_blob(
       "rule test { strings: $a = \" cmd.exe \" nocase wide condition: $a }",
       ISSUE_1006);
